This is the GitHub Repository for BST 260 Final Project. This project aims to apply data science and machine learning techniques to predict customer revenue. The dataset retrieves from Kaggle website. Motivation of the project comes from three parts:

1) 80/20 Rule: In e-commerce industry, small percentage of customers contribute to most of the revenue
2) Given the large dataset we have, machine learning may play an important role in prediction
3) Eventually we are hoping to transfrom our analysis into actionable operational changes so that we would be able to have a better utilization of marketing resources.

This project could be divided up into three main parts, i.e., Data Wrangling, R shiny, regression, and machine learning. 

## Data Wrangling

In data wrangling, main parts could be summarized as 1) transforming non-standard format data (JSON) into standard data, 2) deal with missing values

## R Shiny


## Regression


## Machine Learning

Here we play with two types of machine learning, one being bagging based Random Forest, another one being boosting based XGBoost. Bagging and Boosting have different mechanisms, and given large percentage of categorical variables in our dataset, we are hoping to have a better comparison of model performances by applying that into the dataset.
